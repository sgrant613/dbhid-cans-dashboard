# CANS SaaS Solution for Kentucky DBHDID
## Presentation Narrative: Unified Visibility Across 14 CMHCs

---

## OPENING: You're Already Here—Let's Talk About What's Next

- DBHDID's High Fidelity Wraparound (HFW) program is **already running CANS assessments through the Objective Arts platform**
- CMHCs are entering HFW youth into our system today—you've experienced how it works
- **The opportunity**: What you're doing for HFW can scale to give DBHDID complete visibility across all 14 CMHCs and the broader populations you oversee
- **The question**: Are you extracting the full strategic value from a tool you're already using?

**What you have now (HFW only):**
- CANS data collection for a subset of youth
- Basic compliance tracking for HFW requirements

**What a formal engagement unlocks:**
- Statewide dashboards aggregating all 14 CMHCs
- Comparative performance analytics between centers
- Outcome reporting for federal grants and legislative briefings
- Early warning systems for quality and capacity issues

## VALUE PROPOSITION 1: Statewide Population Visibility

**"See your entire system at a glance"**

- **Unified dashboard** showing all youth served across 14 CMHCs in real-time
- **Population counts by region** with demographic breakdowns
- **Caseload distribution** revealing which centers are under capacity vs. stretched thin
- **Geographic mapping** of where needs concentrate across Kentucky's 120 counties

**Why this matters to DBHDID:**
- Federal grant reporting (KY SIX System of Care, block grants) requires aggregate population data
- Legislative briefings demand clear, defensible numbers on who you're serving and where
- Resource allocation decisions should be data-driven, not anecdotal
- TASA compliance requires documented community-based service delivery metrics

**Current state without this:** Each of the 14 CMHCs operates as its own data silo. Aggregating for any statewide view requires manual collection and reconciliation—if it happens at all.

---

## VALUE PROPOSITION 2: Inbound Severity & Outbound Outcomes

**"Know what's coming in and whether you're making a difference"**

- **Intake severity profiles**: See the acuity level of new cases entering each CMHC
  - CANS domain scores at intake (Behavioral/Emotional Needs, Risk Behaviors, Life Functioning)
  - Trauma exposure indicators (Potentially Traumatic/Adverse Childhood Experiences)
  - Caregiver resource levels that predict placement stability and service intensity needs

- **Outcome trajectories over time**:
  - Track movement from actionable needs (2s and 3s) to resolved needs (0s and 1s)
  - Monitor strength-building progress across 6-month reassessment intervals
  - Calculate reliable change metrics showing clinically meaningful improvement vs. statistical noise

- **Discharge readiness indicators**:
  - Youth approaching step-down thresholds
  - Risk profiles at discharge predicting likelihood of re-entry

**Why this matters to DBHDID:**
- Demonstrate ROI on HFW and intensive community services
- Identify which service models correlate with positive outcomes
- Justify continued Medicaid and block grant funding with hard outcome data
- Meet SAMHSA reporting requirements for System of Care grants

**What you're missing with HFW-only:** You see outcomes for the most intensive cases but have no visibility into whether the broader CMHC populations are improving—or whether issues are brewing before they escalate to HFW-level intensity.

## VALUE PROPOSITION 3: Comparative Center Performance & Early Warning

**"Spot problems before they become crises"**

- **Center-to-center benchmarking**:
  - Average intake severity by CMHC (risk-adjusted for regional demographics)
  - Outcome improvement rates compared across the 14 regions
  - Assessment completion and reassessment timeliness
  - Caseload-to-outcome efficiency patterns

- **Variance alerts and outlier detection**:
  - Flag centers with unusual spikes in high-acuity intakes (disaster aftermath, opioid surges, etc.)
  - Identify regions where outcomes are lagging peers—before families file complaints
  - Surface assessment completion gaps indicating workforce or training issues

- **Drill-down capability**:
  - Click any center to see domain-level detail
  - Identify specific need areas (e.g., substance use, trauma, caregiver capacity) driving regional differences
  - Export data for targeted technical assistance planning

**Why this matters to DBHDID:**
- Proactive quality improvement vs. reactive crisis management
- Target limited TA resources to centers that need them most
- Evidence base for contract negotiations and performance expectations
- Early identification of workforce or capacity issues before service failures
- Post-disaster monitoring (Four Rivers after 2021 tornadoes, Eastern Mountain after 2022 flooding)

## WHAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE

**You're not starting from scratch:**

- ✅ **Kentucky CANS 5+ 2.0** fully configured in our platform
- ✅ **HFW population** already being assessed through CMHCs in our system
- ✅ **Multi-identifier support** for youth without TWIST integration (exactly what you need for non-child-welfare populations)
- ✅ **Tagging capability** for population segmentation (HFW, KY SIX target populations, etc.)
- ✅ **Proven Kentucky integration** via DCBS/TWIST—we know how to work with CHFS systems

**What formalization adds:**

- Dedicated DBHDID instance with role-based access for state-level oversight
- Dashboard and reporting layer configured for your specific KPIs
- Training and support structure for CMHC users beyond HFW staff
- Contracted SLAs ensuring system availability and responsiveness

---

## THE DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Continuing as-is (HFW only, informal):**
- Limited to one population slice
- No statewide visibility
- No comparative analytics
- Federal reporting requires separate data collection
- You're using a system without the support structure to maximize value

**Formalizing a DBHDID engagement:**
- Single source of truth across all 14 regions and populations
- Real-time dashboards for leadership, legislators, federal partners
- Actionable intelligence on where to deploy resources
- Defensible outcome data for every dollar of state and federal investment
- Proper support, training, and partnership structure

## VISUALIZATION PREVIEW

The accompanying interactive dashboard demonstrates:

1. **Statewide Map View**: All 14 CMHCs with color-coded indicators showing:
   - Current caseload volume
   - Average intake severity
   - Outcome improvement rates

2. **Severity-to-Outcome Flow**: Sankey diagram showing how cases move from intake acuity levels through treatment to discharge outcomes

3. **Center Comparison Matrix**: Side-by-side metrics allowing instant identification of high performers and centers needing attention

4. **Trend Alerts Panel**: Flagging unusual patterns that warrant investigation

## SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS

**On the HFW situation:**
"You've been getting value from our platform through HFW. We're glad it's working. The question is whether DBHDID wants to formalize this relationship and unlock the full capabilities—or continue with a partial view of one population."

**On cost:**
"We've served state behavioral health systems for 25 years with near-100% customer retention. We price for sustainable partnership. What's the cost of *not* having this visibility when the next legislative inquiry comes, or the next federal site visit?"

**On implementation:**
"The Kentucky CANS is already configured. Your CMHCs already know the system through HFW. This isn't a 12-month implementation—it's extending what's already working."

**On the 14 independent boards:**
"We understand each CMHC is its own entity. The platform supports regional autonomy while giving DBHDID the aggregate view you need for oversight. Centers see their data; you see everyone's."
